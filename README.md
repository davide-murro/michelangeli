# Michelangeli

Site for the sale of handmade articles like necklaces and bracelets, in this case for a woman who really likes the color pink.
This site is developed started from a template, it is written with HTML, CSS and JQuery with the use of some libraries and is completely responsive

## File structure

- _root_
  HTML pages
- **css**
  Only css files
- **fonts**
  Fonts of the site
- **images**
  All images, icons and logos of the site, divided in subfolders:
  - articles
  - icons
- **js**
  Only javascript files including internal js, libraries and a file for DB
- **sounds**
  Only mp3 files

## Libraries

- **jQuery**
  It is a JavaScript library that makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler
- **fontawesome**
  Internet's icon library and toolkit
- **breakpoints and browser**
  A lightweight library for managing responsive sites and web apps

## Database

Not having a server side it was decided to make a database with a js file (**_db.js_**). <br>
The tables are simple arrays of objects and for each there is a js file that manages it.

- **articles**
  Articles made by the merchant
- **markets**
  All events where the merchant shows his articles live
- **categories**
  This is a simple array of possible article categories

To insert an element into DB just add an object to array into db.js file <br>
Here an example of **_articles_** array (table of DB):

```javascript
var articles = [
  {
    insert: new Date("2018/07/15 19:50"),
    img_thumb: "images/articles/thumbs/collana_lapislazzuli.jpeg",
    img_full: "images/articles/fulls/collana_lapislazzuli.jpeg",
    title: "Collana di lapislazzuli",
    description:
      "Collana di lapislazzuli 67cm circa con copriperle e rondelle con brillantini. Accessori e chiusura in acciaio inox.",
    category: 0,
    price: 30.0,
    size: [67],
  },
  {
    insert: new Date("2018/07/15 19:51"),
    img_thumb: "images/articles/thumbs/collana_ceramica.jpeg",
    img_full: "images/articles/fulls/collana_ceramica.jpeg",
    title: "Collana in ceramica",
    description:
      "Collana in ceramica cm 80 con rondelle con zirconi artificiali e chiusura in acciaio inox.",
    category: 0,
    price: 25.0,
    size: [80],
  },
];
```

## HTML structure

The site is made in one page, creating the skeleton in HTML and then including parts and information by javascript:

- **_header_**
  Simple fixed header where are placed the filter and a button to activate the background sound
- **_introduction_**
  That contains a short history of the merchant and his contacts
- **_articles_**
  Here are loaded the articles from the db by javascript
- **_footer_**
  Simple footer
